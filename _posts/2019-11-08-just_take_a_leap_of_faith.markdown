In the 90’s, when I first began working with JavaScript, my mentors would tell me “Just take a leap of Faith.  It is going to work. It will do all of these things for you.”   Me, coming from a COBOL background, where you had to build everything yourself, just didn’t want to believe. 

I  didn’t like giving up that much control to something unknown.  There were no books explaining how everything worked or why.  There definitely wasn’t the web resources’ that we have now.  I didn’t have a  way to step through all of the code to make sure that it would do exactly what I wanted it to do.  I couldn’t compartmentalize all of the repeated routines for easy calls.  I felt like I was giving up a lot just to have this work on the Intranet/Internet.  It was very scary for me as a programmer.  

But, my customer, the HR department, wanted a way to do 360 evaluations with a thin client that the field managers could access.  The field managers were used to logging in to an AS400 to do anything. And it was very slow and time consuming, not to mention that everything was done via modem.  This caused them to get knocked off frequently and lose what they had been working on.  If you are old enough, you may remember the “DON’T PICK UP THE PHONE, I’M WORKING”  rant from modem users.  And the prayer that no one called while you were using the modem.

Anyway, as a programmer then, you learned what was needed to accomplish your project and become proficient at it.  If you were lucky, you had time to go back and figure out the how’s and why’s of things.  I never seemed to get that luxury of free time.  My position changed, and I was no longer programming, so I didn’t get to go back and find out what was going on with Javascript, and frankly I was too busy to worry about it, but I still sometimes wondered.

Now, enter Ruby , many years later.  Working in Ruby, I was thinking, Ok, all of this is familiar, but I’m not seeing that “Leap of Faith” stuff.  I’m writing everything, so where is the “Magic”.  I want to have Faith.  

Guess what?  I found “Faith”.  It is called ActiveRecord.  And I also know what is happening in the background and why.  I can actually tell you what is going on and why I don’t have to include the code in my program.   This explains sooooooooo many things.  

While the beginning part of Ruby seems so drawn out, just wait, there is more to come.  Just take that “Leap of Faith”, be patient, and wait for the magic to happen.
