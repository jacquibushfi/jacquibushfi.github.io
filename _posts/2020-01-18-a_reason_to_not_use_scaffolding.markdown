Scaffolding in rails is a great way to get started quickly on an application that you need to develop.  It creates the basics of everything that you include.  You don’t have to remember any of the major pieces or where they go or the basic code to get started.  It creates the structure for your CRUD , controllers, models, and views.  Using scaffolding can save you a lot of time.

When you are starting out programming in Rails, what are you giving up by using this time-saving “magic”?  You are giving up the understanding of how all of the parts and pieces work and why.  It’s like growing up and having someone do everything for you.  If you go out on your own, and those someone’s are no longer there, what do you do?  You flounder and make a lot of mistakes learning the process, experience high anxiety, pressure if it is a time sensitive process, and a whole host of things.  

If you take the time in the beginning to truly understand your environment, why things work the way they do, and how to adjust them when necessary, you come out way ahead.   Understanding the basics will allow you to become a better developer.  You will be able to customize processes with a clear understanding of what is happening a whole lot faster than if you have to go back and adjust prewritten code.  Do you really know what rails is doing and why, how it seems to just know where to go, and how to change those things effectively and efficiently? 

Take the time now, it will save you time in the long run.
