The fear of the empty page.  What do you do first, what pieces or parts do you start with?  First, step away from the computer.  

Start with the big picture.  Jot down those big things, then start breaking down those big things into medium sized things.  Once you have a bunch of medium sized things, break those down into small things.  Then take those small things and break them down into micro steps of how to get to the small thing.

Just like building in Lego's.  You have an idea of what you want to build, the end result if you will.  But you can't build the outside before you build the inside.  The inside is a bunch of little parts that all have to fit together before you can get to that end result.  

A good practice is to start writing down everything you do from the time you get out of bed in the morning until you are dressed and ready to go to work.   List out the major things you do, then break those down into small tasks, and then list out the exact steps you take to accomplish that small task, in the order that it needs to happen.  You will become aware of things you do without thinking about it.  Practice breaking stuff down with everything.

This practice will allow you to see in detail, what all needs to occur in what order.  Details are the most important thing in programming.  Your software may do a lot for you, but you need to know the details to get started.
