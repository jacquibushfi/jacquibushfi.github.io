Sometimes it takes a little while for things to sink in.  Our cohort lead kept telling us to believe the magic.  But it was so hard to believe.  I like to make sure I know where things are and when they move or change.  In other words, I’m a control freak.

Enter the world of Imperative and Declarative Programming. 

**Imperative Programming:**
* Explicityly describes the actions a program should take
* Describes *how* a program should go about doing those actions
* example - removing the least element from an array:
*      access the element at index arr.length - 1 from this array and and eraseit from memory
*      resize the array to have 1 less element at the end
*      return to me this array

**Declarative Programming:**
* Describes what a program should accomplish (or what the end resuld should be)
* Leaves the determination of how to get to the end result up to the program
* example - removing the last element from an array:
*     I have the array: [1, 2, 3]
*     I want an array like that but without the tail element
*     Make it so, computer


I originally learned Imperative Programming back 100 years ago.  You had to tell the computer everything.  There was no magic to believe in.  You just kept writing the same things over and over.  Get this data from here, verify it, massage it, save it, display it, ….  Rinse and Repeat.  The program would have a million lines of code to comb through and heaven help you if you forgot a period or spelled something incorrectly.  All of the things that bugs are made of.

With React, I had to keep reminding myself that it was ok to let go and just believe the magic.  It is hard to let go, but I learned that  if I do, programming becomes something that is not so tedious.  You can spend more time on the fun parts of solving the puzzle.  You can let the control freak in you relax and enjoy your passion.
