Like most of the other blogs I have read, it feels good to have made it through to the first CLI Project.  I was a little apprehensive about returning to "school" and development in general, but I have survived so far.

I did development back in the 80's and '90's but have not touched it since then. There have been many changes,  but the general concepts and methodologies are pretty much the same.  

The CLI project has reminded me of these things.  

1. Don't try to memorize everything.  You have Google (wish we had that back then), or books, or teammates to help.

2. Just do something.  The hardest part is getting started.  Start by writing out your thoughts.

3. Do one thing at a time.  Test it, Save it!!  Don't try to code a bunch all at once.  One thought at a time.

4. You find out it really wasn't as hard as you thought.

5. You got this.  You can do this.  Stop doubting yourself.
