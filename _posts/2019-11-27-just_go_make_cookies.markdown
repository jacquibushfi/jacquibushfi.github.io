How do you know when it is time to just go make cookies?  The real kind, not the ones that get stored on your computer.  Is it when you get so far down a rabbit hole that you start confusing yourself on everything you are trying to prepare for?

With extra time to think about my Sinatra Project and what I wanted to do, I began laying things out on paper.  I was trying to keep it small, but all of the exciting things that I could possibly do began the long slide of scope creep.  

Google was becoming my best friend.  Partials? Yes, that sounded good.  I could organize my code for navigation and make things look nice.  Oh look, there is Heroku, that would be so good also for easy installation and using a new tool.  Hey, let’s add that other table so we can do a Has_many through.  What is a cool thing to do for validation and authentication?  Maybe a little Regex?  Ohhhh  how about using a form builder so that my pages look  professional with all of the HTML and CSS. Oh yeah, this is becoming the best project yet!!!

I spent at least 12 hours going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole.  It was getting really deep and scope creep really didn’t describe what I was coming up with.  All of the reading and researching had me beginning to question everything I thought I understood  about MVC, CRUD, Helpers, Scope, Views, Controllers, and how to describe what my project was doing.  I started questioning everything, was this association  really a belongs to? or was it a has_one.   I wasn’t sure anymore, more Googling, more going back and reading everything, looking at other completed projects.........

***STOP!!!!!!!!***  Just go make cookies.

So now I have about 12 dozen cookies of different flavors ready for the freezer.  I think that was the best 8 hours of study time.  Back to the requirements only first, get that working and then I can go visit some of my rabbit holes.
